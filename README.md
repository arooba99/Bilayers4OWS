## Project Overview

This study combines **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** and **Supervised Machine Learning** to:
- Predict structural and ground-state electronic properties of 2D vdW bilayers.
- Identify suitable hexagonal bilayer combinations for **overall water-splitting (OWS)** photocatalysis.
- Accelerate screening of novel heterostructures beyond traditional trial-and-error approaches.
